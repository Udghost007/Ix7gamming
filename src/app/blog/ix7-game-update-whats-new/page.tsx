Average launch time dropped from 3.4 seconds to 2.0 seconds across all tested devices." },

On devices with 2–3 GB of RAM, this eliminates the out-of-memory crashes that affected approximately 4% of sessions in the previous version. The improvement comes from smarter texture compression and aggressive garbage collection during scene transitions." },
