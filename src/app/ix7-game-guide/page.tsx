              { title: "Bankroll Management", desc: "Divide your total balance into at least twenty equal units. Never risk more than one unit on a single prediction. This ensures you can withstand losing streaks without depleting your balance. If you lose five rounds in a row, take a break and return with a clear mind rather than chasing losses." },

Instead of withdrawing referral commissions immediately, many intermediate players reinvest a portion into their gameplay balance, effectively playing with house money while keeping their original deposit safe." },

              { tip: "Track Your Results", detail: "Keep a simple spreadsheet or note tracking your daily deposits, withdrawals, wins, and losses. Reviewing your data weekly reveals patterns in your own behavior — like times of day when you perform better or game modes where your win rate is highest." },

Study the format, understand the bracket structure, and practice in regular lobbies before entering paid tournaments. The competition is tougher, but the rewards justify the effort." },

Plan your deposit schedule to maintain VIP status consistently rather than making sporadic large deposits. Steady activity earns VIP points more efficiently." },
